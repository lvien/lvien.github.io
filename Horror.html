									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<div class="project">
										<div>
											<p>
												In this Silent Hill/Resident Evil inspired survival-horror game, you play as Elijah, a brave 11 year old boy who takes his beloved dog Duke out on a walk through a quiet cul-de-sac in 1990s America. The small neighborhood is suddenly transformed into a living hell that evening. With little ways of defending yourself, you must solve puzzles, avoid hazards, survive supernatural threats, and rescue Duke before it is too late. This Unreal Engine 5 game
												is in development, with level demos viewable. This game is planned to be shipped to Steam within late 2024/early 2025.</p>

									<h2>Design Concepts</h2>
									<b class="info">The Ghost Woman</b>
									<article>
										<div>
											<p>The ghost woman is bound only by lit areas, and when the player steps into the same light source
												she will immediately charge and attack. She can teleport to any other light the player steps into.
												The player must navigate to the end of the level while avoiding lights, finding alternate routes, turning off lights, or quickly running through.<br/><br/>

												The challenge of programming the mechanic was a lack of a built-in light detection feature for Unreal Engine. I achieved this by creating a base class, which
												could be inherited by light source objects (ceiling lights, lamps, etc.). The base class had a collision area component, which detects an overlapping player - this was the "player in light"
												check. This component set the boundary for the ghost's movement via a navmesh applied to the actor's navigation filter.<br><br/>

												The ghost actor, whose AI is programmed by a behavior tree, would check if the player was standing in a light area. If the player is in the same light, the ghost would charge at them.
												If the player was in another light source, the ghost would execute the teleport mechanic.<br><br/>
												<!--
												I wanted to take a reverse twist on the horror-survival rule of staying in the light;
												this ghost gets you when you're in the light. The inspiration came when I was walking home late at night on a quiet street, and imagined
												 an eerie vision of a figure standing under a streetlamp in the distance. Suddenly the light would blink and
												 it would instantly appear under the lamp right next of me. I was also inspired by horror movies <i>Lights Out</i> and <i>The Vanishing on 7th Street</i>,
												although conversely they emphasized the safety of staying in light.-->

									<b class="info">Shadow Men</b>
									<article>
										<div>
											<p>In this game you would rely on your flashlight to navigate most of the dark areas of levels. I wanted to enhance the experience of flashlight-heavy horror games where you simply reveal enemies in the dark;
												Shadow men are completely invisible, but they cast shadows in the light. The player could only reveal them by lights. I made the flashlight's beam only faintly revealing their shadows.
												Therefore the flashlight's reliability was limited and the player would be incentivized to utilize the environment.<br/><br/>

												The shadow men also do not step foot into lighted areas (the same light area the ghost woman uses), so the player would be safe - but I am debating on keeping or discarding this mechanic throughout development
												so I could leverage their unique shadow-casting visual.<br/><br/>

												In the early stages the shadow men had the <i>Lights Out</i> mechanic, where they would disappear when illuminated. However, I felt this mechanic wasn't challenging enough, and was more of peek-a-boo. I wanted
												the player to be pursued, paranoid, and not safe.

									<b class="info">Door Navigation</b>
									<article>
										<div>
											<p>For now, enemies have a simple Navigation AI for chasing a target. They will navigate around obstacles and can interact with doors, treating them as a valid path. Enemies cannot open locked doors,
												nor will they attempt to open one, but once unlocked the AI will include it in their valid path. This was achieved by placing a NavLink component on doors. Locked doors
												disable the NavLink, and reactivate once they are unlocked.<br/>
												Below are demonstrations of behavior in 3 different scenarios:
